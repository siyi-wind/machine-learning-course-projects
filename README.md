Including some machine learning and artificial intellegent examples 
## Maze problem based on A star agorithem
* [artificial_intelligence.py](https://github.com/siyi-wind/machine-learning-course-projects/blob/master/maze_search_A_star/artificial_intelligence%3B.py) uses local optimum agorithm.
* [search_Astar.py](https://github.com/siyi-wind/machine-learning-course-projects/blob/master/maze_search_A_star/search_Astar.py)* [](https://github.com/siyi-wind/machine-learning-course-projects/blob/master/maze_search_A_star/search_Astar.py) uses Hamiltonian distance as h function.
* [search_Astar2.py](https://github.com/siyi-wind/machine-learning-course-projects/blob/master/maze_search_A_star/search_Astar2.py) uses Euler distance as h function, and neglects the situation extension node appears in the close table. 

## EEG-MI classification
The model is based on [A novel approach of decoding EEG four-class motor imagery tasks via scout ESI and CNN](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ab4af6/meta). This paper classifies the data into 4 catogories, I classifies the data into 3.
